          I am amazed when I think about the moment You first imagined her‚Äîlong
          before You breathed life into her through her wonderful parents,
          Pavani and Dharmendar. I can picture You smiling with joy, carefully
          blending everything that makes her special. "Let‚Äôs add a little
          mischief," You must have thought. "Let‚Äôs give her the ability to see
          beauty in everything. Let‚Äôs make her curious, thoughtful, and someone
          who takes the time to understand things deeply before acting." Then,
          maybe You paused for a moment and smiled even wider. "Oh yes, just
          last month, I created Nicky. These two will be a perfect match!" You
          must have been so excited, knowing how their love story would unfold,
          how they would learn from each other, grow together, and cherish
          life‚Äôs moments side by side. And in Your heart, You must have
          whispered, "What a beautiful love story this will be." ‚ù§Ô∏è

          and I want to be someone who brings that happiness to you. This love I
          have for you is a precious gift from God, and I promise to cherish and

          details that make you, you. your voice sqeeezes at the end when you
          speak loudly, the way you take your time to make careful decisions‚ÄîI
          love it all. Your wide, joyful laughter lights up my world, and every
          moment with you feels special. I admire your kindness, your patience,
          and the way you make even the simplest moments feel meaningful. Being
          with you is a blessing, and I want to spend my days making you smile,

            Yeah, it's not a thing‚Äîit's a person. My favorite person. Sreeja.
            She‚Äôs not just where I feel at home‚Äîshe is home. When I‚Äôm with her,
            the world slows down, like a dream where everything else fades
            except her. It‚Äôs like she‚Äôs the only one moving at normal speed
            while everything around us is caught in slow motion. And oh, she
            buzzes‚Äîconstantly, filling every silence with her energy, her
            laughter, her endless little stories. And when she falls quiet, I
            take my turn, buzzing around her, keeping the rhythm alive, because
            that‚Äôs what we do. Sometimes, we just sit in silence, and sometimes,
            we quarrel. We dream of the future together, we face problems
            together, we track down our misunderstandings and solve
            them‚Äîtogether. We aren‚Äôt just in a relationship; we‚Äôre building
            something, shaping something‚Äîa home for both of us. Because to me,
            home isn‚Äôt four walls and a roof. Home is a person. And she is my
            perfect home.
