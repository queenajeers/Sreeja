            I am amazed when I think about the moment You first imagined
            her‚Äîlong before You breathed life into her through her wonderful
            parents, Pavani and Dharmendar. I can picture You smiling with joy,
            carefully blending everything that makes her special. "Let‚Äôs add a
            little mischief," You must have thought. "Let‚Äôs give her the ability
            to see beauty in everything. Let‚Äôs make her curious, thoughtful, and
            someone who takes the time to understand things deeply before
            acting." Then, maybe You paused for a moment and smiled even wider.
            "Oh yes, just last month, I created Nicky. These two will be a
            perfect match!" You must have been so excited, knowing how their
            love story would unfold, how they would learn from each other, grow
            together, and cherish life‚Äôs moments side by side. And in Your
            heart, You must have whispered, "What a beautiful love story this
            will be." ‚ù§Ô∏è

              Yeah, it's not a thing‚Äîit's a person. My favorite person. Sreeja.
              She‚Äôs not just where I feel at home‚Äîshe is home. When I‚Äôm with
              her, the world slows down, like a dream where everything else
              fades except her. It‚Äôs like she‚Äôs the only one moving at normal
              speed while everything around us is caught in slow motion. And oh,
              she buzzes‚Äîconstantly, filling every silence with her energy, her
              laughter, her endless little stories. And when she falls quiet, I
              take my turn, buzzing around her, keeping the rhythm alive,
              because that‚Äôs what we do. Sometimes, we just sit in silence, and
              sometimes, we quarrel. We dream of the future together, we face
              problems together, we track down our misunderstandings and solve
              them‚Äîtogether. We aren‚Äôt just in a relationship; we‚Äôre building
              something, shaping something‚Äîa home for both of us. Because to me,
              home isn‚Äôt four walls and a roof. Home is a person. And she is my
              perfect home.

            I love when song lyrics remind me of you. I listen to them on
